# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains basic implementations of Machine Learning algorithms to build foundational understanding. The projects include implementations using both standard libraries and manual methods.

## Projects

### 1. **Implementing Linear Regression Using Standard Library (Scikit-learn)**  
   - **File:** `Implementing_linear_regression_using_Standard_Library_(scikit_learn).ipynb`  
   - **Description:**  
     This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using the Scikit-learn library. It includes:  
     - Data preprocessing  
     - Model training and evaluation  
     - Visualizing the regression line  
   - **Purpose:**  
     To understand how to use Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class for a real-world dataset.

### 2. **Implementing Linear Regression from Scratch**  
   - **File:** `Implementing_Linear_Regression_from_scratch.ipynb`  
   - **Description:**  
     This project manually implements Linear Regression without any libraries, covering:  
     - Derivation of the cost function  
     - Gradient Descent for optimization  
     - Prediction and evaluation metrics  
   - **Purpose:**  
     To gain a deeper understanding of the mathematics and logic behind Linear Regression.

## Requirements
